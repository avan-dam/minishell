ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

The variables that come up when env is typed in:
TERM_PROGRAM=
    TERM_PROGRAM is used in /etc/zshrc and /etc/bashrc to run commands that are specific
    to the terminal program you are using when they open a shell. By default, macOS 
    supplies /etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal and /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal which do some extra 
    work to manage the current working directory and support suspending and resuming the terminal. 
    If you use another terminal program, you can place a file at /etc/zshrc_$TERM_PROGRAM 
    or /etc/bashrc_$TERM_PROGRAM and it will be executed when your terminal program opens a shell.
    You have to ensure that your terminal program sets a value for $TERM_PROGRAM of course.

SHELL=
    This environment variable expands to the full pathname to the shell. If it is 
    not set when the shell starts, Bash assigns to it the full pathname of the current 
    user’s login shell.

TERM=
    This specifies the type of terminal to emulate when running the shell. Different
    hardware terminals can be emulated for different operating requirements.
    You usually won’t need to worry about this though.

TMPDIR=
    If set, Bash uses its value as the name of a directory in which Bash creates
    temporary files for the shell’s use.

TERM_PROGRAM_FUNCTION=
    cant find

TERM_SESSION_ID=
    cant find

USER=
    The current logged in user.

SSH_AUTH_SOCK=
    contains the path of the unix file socket that the agent uses for
    communication with other processes. This is essential for ssh-add.

PATH=
    A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.
    A zero-length (null) directory name in the value of PATH indicates the current
    directory. A null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons,
    or as an initial or trailing colon.

_=
    The most recent previously executed command. When 
    env has been run it should show: /usr/bin/env

PWD=
    The current working directory as set by the cd builtin.

XPC_FLAGS=
XPC_SERVICE_NAME=
SHLVL=
    environment variable holds the number of shell levels the current shell is running on top of.

HOME=
    The current user’s home directory; the default for the cd builtin command.
    The value of this variable is also used by tilde expansion 
    (see Section 3.5.2 [Tilde Expansion], page 24).

LOGNAME=
LC_CTYPE=
    This variable determines the interpretation of characters and the behavior of
    character classes within filename expansion and pattern matching 
    (see Section 3.5.8 [Filename Expansion], page 33).


Other values that need to be done:

OLDPWD=
    The previous working directory. This is kept by the shell in order to switch back
    to your previous directory by running cd -.
